# Troubleshooting

## USB

- A ring that stays solid blue at the fastboot gesture can mean a cable that
  carries power but no data, or a bad USB connection. Try another cable, then
  another port. On Windows it can also mean the
  [drivers](https://github.com/bboe/firebreak#windows) are missing.
- A ring that restarts instead of reaching TWRP, blue with about a second of
  turning cyan and little or no white, has been a USB port that cannot power
  it. To tell, hold the + button with the device on a USB wall charger: a ring
  that reaches white there means TWRP runs. Then use another port. A USB 3
  port on the computer itself, with nothing else on it, is the most reliable.
- An Echo that drops off USB during a TWRP step, more than once, has also been
  a port that cannot power it. Where the run says boot0 may hold no
  preloader, run firebreak again first. If it fails the same way, unplug the
  Echo, run firebreak again, and plug it into another port.
- A `/system` write that keeps failing with `failed to read copy response: EOF`
  can mean a poor USB connection. Unplug both ends of the cable, plug them back
  in firmly, and try another cable if it fails again.

## Windows

- The drivers have x86 and x64 builds only, so on Windows on ARM the steps
  that use fastboot or the bootrom cannot run.
- UsbDk has run on Windows 11 23H2. mtkclient reports it broken on 25H2
  (build 26200).
- On a Windows older than 11 23H2, `tar` cannot unpack a `.7z`. It prints an
  error, but PowerShell runs the rest of the setup. An Echo Dot (3rd
  Generation) then stops because it finds no libusb. Unpack
  `VS2022\MS64\dll\libusb-1.0.dll` from `%TEMP%\libusb.7z` into
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\libusb` with 7-Zip, and keep its folders.

## An Echo Dot (2nd Generation) with no light

Use `firebreak short` when the Dot shows no light and gives no fastboot. It
reaches the Dot's bootrom by shorting its eMMC bus as it powers up, and holds
it there. The run after it joins that payload with no second short, so this is
how a target run starts on a Dot that cannot reach fastboot.

1. Open the Dot with a Torx T8 screwdriver. Lift the shield's lid off the eMMC
   by its corners; its metal frame stays on the board.
2. Find the passive marked in [this
   photo](https://xdaforums.com/attachments/short2-jpg.6273804/), in the row
   between R60 and C52 beside the eMMC ([where that is on the
   board](https://andygoetz.org/blog/2022/05/echo-dot-v2-dumping-emmc/)). Do not
   use C52, which is a capacitor.
3. With the Dot unplugged, run
   `uvx firebreak@latest short --device biscuit`.
4. When firebreak prints "Short … test point and plug it in", hold a wire from
   that passive to the shield frame beside it, which is ground, and plug the Dot
   in. A Dot plugged in before that message can go unseen. On "Short … missed",
   unplug it and try again.
5. Take the wire off when firebreak prints "The short may come off now".
6. Leave the Dot plugged in, and run the target you want, such as
   `uvx firebreak@latest unlock`. A power cycle loses the hold.

## An Echo rooted by an older firebreak

An Echo rooted on Fire OS 6 by firebreak 1.1.x or earlier lets anyone on its
network into its root adb. One rooted by 1.0.0 or earlier also has only a
raised build number against Amazon's updates. Amazon's update server offered
nothing to that number on 2026-11-11, but `otad` still runs and the hosts file
blocks nothing.

On a Fire OS 6 build older than 8349, run a plain `unlock`. It downloads
8349, reboots the Echo into TWRP and installs 8349 over the old build. It
adds what is missing, and the Echo keeps its setup.

On 8349, a plain `unlock` says the Echo is rooted and stops. To add what is
missing there and keep the setup, start in its TWRP:

```sh
uvx firebreak@latest twrp
uvx firebreak@latest unlock
```

From TWRP, the unlock installs `boot-root.zip` again, blocks updates and
locks adb in each Fire OS 6 slot, and starts Fire OS.
`unlock --factory-reset` also adds them, but installs Fire OS 6 again and
erases the Echo.
